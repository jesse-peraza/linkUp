# linkUp

**linkUp** is a mimic of the application "YikYak", an application designed to create fleeting anonimous connections. This app was developed with the premise of being able to interact among people that have an existing connection, something that they already have in common. Imagine being at a party, concert, sporting event, or any big gathering or even just at school or in a new city; these are all situations where you're already connected to people you don't know because you all have something in common. Being able to interact with people and share your thoughts anonimously in these scenarios leads to a lot of fun and a lot of interesting interactions.
